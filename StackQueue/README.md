## Creating a Queue using a two stacks implemented using generic linked lists

At first, I thought that this might prove to be difficult to do, considering the amount of abstraction involved. However, with minor 
modifications to the removeFront() and pop() functions in the list and stack classes respectively, it was fairly simple to do because
it was just a matter of using the same functions I had spent a long time writing for my list and stack.
On a sidenote, it was fun to see how many levels of abstraction can be achieved, and I'm guessing it can go wayyy further this. But, as 
it is, this seems to be quite unholy so I'll leave it at this.
